# [PARAM]

save: 0
# Whether to save the classified catalogue as fileout

compute_distrib: 1
# Compute the probability densities of the input catalog thanks
# to its known objects

categories: ['location', 'spectrum', 'multiwavelength', 'variability']
# Categories of properties; works even when no property is in a
# certain category
global_coeffs: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
# 1 weighting coefficient for missing values (usually 1)
# and then 1 coefficient per category

custom_pty: [['b', 2]]
# [Property,  Class] for which the probability density is customed, 
# to limit bias. Currently, working only for Galactic latitude.
